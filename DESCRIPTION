Description: These datasets contain daily and hourly quality air measurements in 
  Spain over a period of 18 years (from 2001 to 2018). The measurements refer to 
  several pollutants. These data are openly published by the Government of Spain.  
  The datasets are originally spread over a number of files and formats. Here, 
  the same information is contained in simple dataframes for convenience of 
  researches, journalists or general public. See the Spanish Government website 
  <https://bit.ly/2Ojnpwy> for more information.
