## airqualityES


These dataset contains daily quality air measurements in Spain over a period of 18 years (from 2001 to 2018). The measurements refer to 
  several pollutants. These data are openly published by the Government of Spain.  The datasets were originally spread over a number of files and formats. Here, 
  the same information is contained in simple dataframe for convenience of researches, journalists or general public.
